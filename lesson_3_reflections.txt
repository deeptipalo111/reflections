 manual commit:
  Pros-
  1.I can make the necessary commit which I think can actually be valuable.
  Cons-
  1.I may forget to commit. In that case I would be in trouble when trying to find what all 
   changes I have made previously.

 Auto commit:
   Pros:
   1.Automatically saves the files so it becomes easier for referencing the committed files 
   for the future.
   Cons:
   1.Unwanted changes are also committed.
